# VibeTag/TagManager Development Session Closeout

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Project:** TagManager (formerly VibeTag) - macOS utility for managing Finder tags on video files with IINA integration

---

## Session Summary

This session focused on resolving persistent build/deployment issues and implementing IINA integration for automatic file detection. The primary challenge was dealing with macOS App Sandbox restrictions that prevented AppleScript from controlling other applications.

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Resolved Build Cache Issues**
- **Problem:** Despite multiple rebuilds, the app continued executing old code paths
- **Root Cause:** SweetPad VSCode extension was caching old app bundles
- **Solution:**
  - Deleted SweetPad cache: `/Users/jpw/Library/Application Support/Code/User/workspaceStorage/.../sweetpad.sweetpad/bundle/VibeTag`
  - Created entirely new project "TagManager" to force clean state
  - Deleted old DerivedData directories
  - Changed app display name to "TagManager NEW BUILD" for verification

### 2. **Successfully Disabled App Sandbox**
- **Problem:** Xcode kept enabling App Sandbox despite entitlements file setting it to `false`
- **Attempts Made:**
  1. Modified `VibeTag.entitlements` file (didn't work - Xcode overrode it)
  2. Added `com.apple.security.automation.apple-events` entitlement (didn't work - still blocked)
  3. Tried using external helper script (blocked by sandbox)
- **Final Solution:**
  - Opened project in Xcode GUI
  - Manually removed App Sandbox capability from Signing & Capabilities tab
  - **Result:** Build now runs WITHOUT sandbox restrictions ✓

### 3. **Implemented AppleScript IINA Integration**
- **Approach:** Use AppleScript GUI automation to:
  1. Check if IINA is running
  2. Click IINA's "Show in Finder" menu item
  3. Get the selected file path from Finder
- **Location:** `TagManager/VibeTag/IINAConnector.swift`
- **Key Code:** `queryIINAViaAppleScript()` function (lines 84-138)
- **Status:** Code is implemented and compiled, but not yet tested due to session ending

### 4. **Project Structure**
- **Working Directory:** `/Users/jpw/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Code&Scripts/vsc-xcode/vibetag/TagManager`
- **Built App:** `/Users/jpw/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/TagManager-cglvxalxehujcacjfkponnvjruet/Build/Products/Debug/VibeTag2.app`
- **App Name:** VibeTag2.app (displays as "TagManager NEW BUILD")
- **Bundle ID:** homelab.VibeTag2
- **Sandbox:** DISABLED ✓

---

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Features
1. **Floating window** - Stays on top of all apps including fullscreen
2. **Global keyboard shortcut** - Cmd+Shift+T to toggle window
3. **Manual file selection** - File picker works correctly
4. **Tag reading** - Reads Finder tags from selected files (both XML and binary plist formats)
5. **Tag writing** - Writes tags to user-selected files
6. **Menu bar integration** - Shows in menu bar with quit option
7. **7 predefined tags** - Arc, KP, TMP, PRG, HW-SGR, RPLY, Other1
8. **Real-time tag updates** - Changes visible immediately in Finder
9. **Build system** - Clean builds without sandbox

### ⚠️ Not Yet Tested (Pending User Action)
1. **IINA auto-detection** - AppleScript implementation complete but needs testing
2. **Accessibility permissions** - App will need to be granted Accessibility permissions to control IINA via AppleScript
3. **Helper script approach** - Created `/TagManager/get_iina_file.sh` but may not be needed if AppleScript works

---

## Known Issues & Challenges

### Issue #1: AppleScript IINA Integration Not Yet Verified
**Status:** Code implemented, sandbox disabled, but not tested before session ended

**What Should Happen Next:**
1. User runs the app: `/Users/jpw/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/TagManager-cglvxalxehujcacjfkponnvjruet/Build/Products/Debug/VibeTag2.app`
2. User opens a video in IINA
3. User presses Cmd+Shift+T or clicks "Refresh" button
4. macOS will prompt for **Accessibility permissions** - user must grant this
5. App should successfully detect currently playing file from IINA

**Debug Output to Look For:**
```
DEBUG: Checking if IINA is running...
DEBUG: IINA is running
DEBUG: Attempting to query IINA history...
DEBUG: Attempting to get file from IINA via helper script
DEBUG: Got file path from IINA via helper script: /path/to/video.mp4
```

**Previous Error (Should Be Gone):**
```
DEBUG: AppleScript error: System Events got an error: Application isn't running.
```
This was caused by the App Sandbox blocking AppleScript. Since sandbox is now disabled, this should no longer occur.

### Issue #2: Permissions Required
**Accessibility Permission:**
- **Required For:** AppleScript to control IINA's GUI (clicking menu items)
- **How to Grant:**
  1. System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility
  2. Add: `/Users/jpw/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/TagManager-cglvxalxehujcacjfkponnvjruet/Build/Products/Debug/VibeTag2.app`
  3. Enable the toggle

**Full Disk Access:**
- Already granted ✓
- Shown in debug output: `✓ Full Disk Access granted`

## Technical Details

### Files Modified in This Session
1. **IINAConnector.swift** - Implemented AppleScript GUI automation
   - `queryIINAViaAppleScript()` function uses Process() to call helper script
   - Debug logging added throughout

2. **ContentView.swift** - Changed app title to "TagManager NEW BUILD" for verification
   - Line 67: Changed from "VibeTag" to "TagManager NEW BUILD"

3. **VibeTag.entitlements** - Added automation entitlement (though removed when sandbox disabled)
   - Added `com.apple.security.automation.apple-events`

4. **get_iina_file.sh** - Created helper script as alternative approach
   - Location: `/TagManager/get_iina_file.sh`
   - Contains AppleScript to click IINA menu and get file path
   - Made executable with `chmod +x`

### Build Configuration
- **Scheme:** VibeTag2
- **Configuration:** Debug
- **Deployment Target:** macOS 26.0
- **Architecture:** arm64
- **Code Signing:** Ad-hoc (local development)
- **Sandbox:** DISABLED

### Code Architecture
```
IINAConnector.swift
├── isIINARunning() - Check if IINA process exists
├── getCurrentlyPlayingFile() - Main entry point, calls via DispatchQueue
└── queryIINAViaAppleScript() - Execute helper script to get file
    ├── Calls: /bin/bash get_iina_file.sh
    ├── Captures stdout/stderr
    └── Returns file path or throws IINAError
```

## Next Steps (What Needs to Happen)

### Immediate (User Action Required)
1. **Test the current build:**
   - Run: `/Users/jpw/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/TagManager-cglvxalxehujcacjfkponnvjruet/Build/Products/Debug/VibeTag2.app/Contents/MacOS/VibeTag2`
   - Check console output for debug messages
   - Note: Last background process ID was `f497ee`

2. **Grant Accessibility permissions when prompted**
   - macOS will show a dialog when app tries to control IINA
   - Click "Open System Settings" and enable VibeTag2

3. **Verify IINA detection works:**
   - Open a video in IINA
   - Click "Refresh" button in TagManager
   - Check if file path appears and tags load

### If IINA Detection Still Fails
1. **Check debug output** - Look for specific error messages
2. **Verify helper script works independently:**
   ```bash
   /Users/jpw/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Code\&Scripts/vsc-xcode/vibetag/TagManager/get_iina_file.sh
   ```
3. **Alternative approaches:**
   - Try reading IINA's mpv socket (if available)
   - Check IINA's recent files database
   - Use NSAppleScript directly in Swift instead of helper script

### Future Enhancements
1. **Move to /Applications** - Currently running from DerivedData
2. **Proper app icon** - Currently using default
3. **Auto-refresh** - Poll IINA for file changes
4. **Error handling** - Better user feedback for permission issues
5. **Distribution** - Code signing for sharing with others

## Debugging Commands

### Check if app is running
```bash
ps aux | grep -i "VibeTag\|VibeTag2" | grep -v grep
```

### Kill all instances
```bash
pkill -9 -f "VibeTag\|VibeTag2"
```

### Verify sandbox is disabled
```bash
codesign -d --entitlements :- "/Users/jpw/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/TagManager-cglvxalxehujcacjfkponnvjruet/Build/Products/Debug/VibeTag2.app" 2>&1 | grep -i sandbox
```
(Should return no output if sandbox is disabled)

### Check Accessibility permissions
```bash
sqlite3 "/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db" "SELECT client FROM access WHERE service='kTCCServiceAccessibility';"
```

### Test helper script manually
```bash
/Users/jpw/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Code\&Scripts/vsc-xcode/vibetag/TagManager/get_iina_file.sh
```

### Rebuild from scratch
```bash
cd "/Users/jpw/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Code&Scripts/vsc-xcode/vibetag/TagManager"
xcodebuild clean build -scheme VibeTag2 -configuration Debug
```

## Session History Timeline

1. **Initial Problem:** Old code kept running despite rebuilds
2. **Investigation:** Found SweetPad caching issue
3. **Solution Attempt #1:** Clean DerivedData, rebuild - didn't work
4. **Solution Attempt #2:** Change bundle ID to VibeTag2 - didn't work
5. **Solution Attempt #3:** Create entirely new project "TagManager" - partially worked
6. **Discovered:** New code running but AppleScript blocked by sandbox
7. **Attempt #4:** Add `com.apple.security.automation.apple-events` entitlement - didn't work
8. **Attempt #5:** Create external helper script - would also be blocked
9. **Final Solution:** Manually disable App Sandbox in Xcode GUI ✓
10. **Status:** Build succeeded without sandbox, ready for testing

---

## Critical Success Factors

### What Made It Work
1. **Complete project rename** - Broke all caching ties
2. **Manual Xcode GUI intervention** - Only way to truly disable sandbox
3. **Verification via app title** - "TagManager NEW BUILD" confirmed right version running
4. **Process cleanup** - Aggressive killing of all cached processes

### What Didn't Work
1. Modifying entitlements file programmatically
2. Using xcodebuild parameters to override sandbox
3. External helper scripts (sandbox blocks them)
4. Apple Events entitlements (not sufficient without disabling sandbox)

---

## Conclusion

The app is **ready for IINA integration testing**. The core blocker (App Sandbox) has been removed. The AppleScript code is implemented and compiled. The only remaining step is for the user to:

1. Run the new build (VibeTag2.app from TagManager DerivedData)
2. Grant Accessibility permissions when prompted
3. Test with IINA playing a video
4. Check debug console output to verify it works

If IINA detection works, the app will be **fully functional** with all features working as designed.
